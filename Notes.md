# Notes 

## Data Pipeline
1) BQ Scheduled Query > Table 
2) Table > GCS
3) ogr2ogr | tippecanoe > File Directory on GCS

cloud run container to do steps 2+3

web map

## Data
- mlab_server
- asn
- download_Mbps
- min_rtt

aggregate by lat/lon, avg of download_mpbs

## Ideas

- just servers map that doesn't show status (https://siteinfo.mlab-oti.measurementlab.net/v1/sites/locations.json)
- split screen ndt7 & web100
- lines to servers
- color by server
- asn map
- routes over time
- replacing piecewise > outputing data with keys for polygon joins
	- census
	- fcc
	- other non-US stuff
